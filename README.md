Welcome to the Analyze AB Test Results project for Countries and Global Warming!

This project aims to analyze the relationship between a country's carbon emissions and their stance on global warming. We will be analyzing data from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the World Bank to investigate whether countries that are taking action to combat global warming also have lower carbon emissions.

To get started with the project, please make sure you have the following software and packages installed on your machine:

Python 3.7 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
The project is structured into several sections:

Data Wrangling: In this section, we will clean and prepare the data for analysis. We will also merge the two datasets on the country level.
Exploratory Data Analysis: In this section, we will visualize the data and explore the relationship between a country's stance on global warming and their carbon emissions.
Hypothesis Testing: In this section, we will conduct a hypothesis test to determine whether there is a significant difference in carbon emissions between countries that are taking action on global warming and those that are not.
Conclusion: In this final section, we will summarize our findings and draw conclusions about the relationship between a country's stance on global warming and their carbon emissions.
The data used in this project is publicly available and can be found in the "data" folder. The Jupyter Notebook file "analyze_ab_test_results.ipynb" contains all the code used in this project, and it is located in the root directory. You can run the code and modify it to suit your needs.

Thank you for your interest in this project!
